This is where the test code for the propulsion raspberry pi pico will go.

What needs to be tested : 
- [ ] Stepper motors (general rotation, power)
- [ ] Stepper motors (direction)
- [ ] Stepper motors microstepping (is floating input working to get silent steps?)
- [ ] Serial connection with raspberry pi
